            <h2>About my education</h2>

            <p>
                My education has not been long it has only lasted a little bit of time for me. I went too high school and one year of college already and that year of college was in the cyber security degree this degree was something that I choose for the fact that I
                like the security behind computers and I liked learning about bugs and the history of OS and images. The degree just didn't feel right too me so I left the degree and switch degrees too the degree that I am in today.

                <h3>Fishing</h3>

                <p>
                    When I was a kid I would go out too the river with my dad and grampa I had the child fishing pole that they bought me and I would try casting and catching fish that was the start of me loving fishing. Now I enter into different bass fishing compititions
                    with my dad and we will traval around going to these fishing spots too try our hand at it.

                <h3>climbing</h3>

                <p>
                    When I was ten I started going to the climbing gym with my brother this gym was my start at working out and climbing where I found my love the the adranaline that it caused and the just amazing feeling that I got from feeling the air on my back as a climb
                    a tall mountine or the feeling of reaching the top of a tough climb it was just amazing too say the least.
